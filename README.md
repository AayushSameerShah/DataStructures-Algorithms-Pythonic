# DSA in Python

- Cool stuff is here, in the initial secitons like arrays...
- Then got bored as the stuff started to be repitative.
- Left this.

> For a more mature and complete guide to DSA can be found in my another repository [DSA Zero to Mastery](https://github.com/AayushSameerShah/DSA-Zero-to-Mastery)

Cheers! 🍻
