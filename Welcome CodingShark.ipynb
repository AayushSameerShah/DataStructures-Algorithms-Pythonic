As I wrote all the stuff in the `.readme` format. And man, literally it all messed up by GitHub, there was no rendering of letex, the formatting buffed... and what not! Then I took some ***SQL courses***, but I didn't go much deep in them, I mean didn't write much thouroughly as I am used to as just wrote the gists. So, now it is another journey ðŸ˜‰\n",

It is not much *(mostly)* not technical which relates just to the market research stuff still to keep myself entertained, I use web scraping, presentation, tableau etc. Frankly, if you are some one who is from this company... haha please!\n",
